# Isometric2DGame

## Project Overview

This game is developed as part of a programming trial to demonstrate my skills in game development.

The project involves creating a Unity-based game with features such as player movement, AI state machine, combat systems, and showcasing proper GitHub workflow.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following tasks:

### **Task 1: Unity Project and GitHub Setup**

-   Create a new Unity 2D project using the 2D URP template (Version 6000.0.24f1).
-   Initialize Git with a Unity-specific `.gitignore`.
-   Create a GitHub repository and push commits regularly with clear descriptions.
-   Demonstrate Git workflow practices such as branching and pull requests.

### **Task 2: Isometric Player Movement and Input System**

-   Implement player movement using Unity's New Input System.
-   Implement diagonal (isometric) movement with a dynamic Rigidbody2D components.
-   Add an isometric camera with Cinemachine to follow the player.
-   Add basic player animations and an environment.

### **Task 3: AI State Machine for Enemy Behavior**

-   Implement a state machine for the enemy AI with Idle, Patrol, Chase, and Attack states.
-   Add state transitions based on triggers.
-   Implement enemy behavior for the states.
-   Implement dynamic patrol routes, advanced pathfinding and state-based animations.

### **Task 4: Combat System**

-   Add meele and ranged player attacks.
-   Implement player and enemy health systems with simple UI.
-   Add special enemy ability.
-   Implement basic animations and visual effects for combat.
